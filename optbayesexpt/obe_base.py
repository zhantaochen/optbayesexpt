class OptBayesExpt(ParticlePDF):
    """An implementation of sequential Bayesian experiment design.

    OptBayesExpt is a manager that calculates strategies for efficient
    measurement runs. OptBayesExpt incorporates measurement data, and uses
    that information to select settings for measurements with high
    predicted benefit / cost ratios.

    The use cases are situations where the goal is to find the parameters of
    a parametric model.

    The primary functions of this class are to interpret measurement data
    and to calculate effective settings. The corresponding methods that
    perform these functions are ``OptBayesExpt.pdf_update()`` for
    interpretation of new data and either ``OptBayesExpt.opt_setting()`` or
    ``OptBayesExpt.good_setting()`` for calculation of effective settings.

    Instances of OptBayesExpt itself may be used for cases where

    #. Reported measurement data includes measurement uncertainty,
    #. Every measurement is assumed to cost the same amount.
    #. The measurement noise is assumed to be constant

    OptBayesExpt may be inherited by child classes to allow additional
    flexibility.  Examples in the ``demos`` folder show several extensions
    including unknown noise, and setting-dependent costs.

    Args:
        model_function (:obj:`function`): Evaluates the experimental model
            from (:code:`settings`, :code:`parameters`, :code:`constants`)
            arguments, returning single values or arrays depending on the
            arguments.  The :code:`model_function` is very similar to the
            fit function in a least-squares regression. The
            :code:`model_function()` must allow evaluation in both of the
            following forms:

            - :code:`model_function(tuple_of_single_settings,
              tuple_of_parameter_arrays, tuple_of_constants)`, returning an
              array with the same size as one of the parameter arrays.
            - :code:`model_function(tuple_of_setting_arrays,
              tuple_of_single_parameters, tuple_of_constants)`, returning
              an array with the same size as one of the setting arrays.

            The broadcasting feature of numpy arrays provides a convenient
            way to write this type of function for simple analytical models.

            Version 1.1.0 and later support model functions that return
            multiple output channels, e. g. real and imaginary parts or vectors
            expressed as tuples, lists or arrays.

        setting_values (:obj:`tuple` of :obj:`ndarray`):
            Each array in the :code:`setting_values` tuple contains the
            allowed discrete values of a measurement setting.  Applied
            voltage, excitation frequency, and a knob that goes to eleven
            are all examples of settings. For computational speed,
            it is important to keep setting arrays appropriately sized.
            Settings arrays that cover unused setting values, or that use
            overly fine discretization will slow the calculations. Settings
            that are held constant belong in the :code:`constants` array.

        parameter_samples (:obj:`tuple` of :obj:`ndarray`):
            Each array in the :code:`parameter_samples` tuple contains the
            possible values of a model parameter.  In a simple example
            model, :code:`y = m * x + b`, the parameters are :code:`m` and
            :code:`b`.  As with the :code:`setting_values`,
            :code:`parameter_samples` arrays should be kept few and small.
            Parameters that can be assumed constant belong in the
            :code:`constants` array. Discretization should only be fine
            enough to support the needed measurement precision. The
            parameter ranges must also be limited: too broad, and the
            computation will be slow; too narrow, and the measurement may
            have to be adjusted and repeated.

        constants (:obj:`tuple` of :obj:`float`):
            Model constants.  Examples include experimental settings that
            are rarely changed, and model parameters that are well-known
            from previous measurement results.

    Keyword Args:

        n_draws (:obj:`int`): specifies the number of parameter samples used
            in the utility calculation.  Default 30.

        choke (:obj:`float`): If ``choke`` is specified, the likelihood will be
            raised to the ``choke`` power. Occasionally, simulated
            measurement runs will "get stuck," and converge to incorrect
            parameter values. The ``choke`` argument provides a heuristic
            fix for better reliability at the expense of speed.  For values
            ``0.0 < choke < 1.0`` choking reduces the max/min ratio of the
            likelihood and allows more data to influence the parameter
            distribution between resampling events. Default ``None``.

        \*\*kwargs: Keyword arguments passed to the parent ParticlePDF class.

    Attributes:
        model_function (:obj:`function`): Same as the ``model_function``
            parameter above.

        setting_values (:obj:`tuple` of :obj:`ndarray`): A record of the
            setting_values argument.

        allsettings (:obj:`list` of :obj:`ndarray`): Arrays containing all
            possible combinations of the setting values provided in the
            ``setting_values`` argument.

        setting_indices (:obj:`ndarray` of :obj:`int`): indices in to
            the allsettings arrays. Used in ``opt_setting()`` and
            ``good_setting()``.

        parameters (:obj:`ndarray` of :obj:`ndarray`): The most recently
            set of parameter samples the parameter distribution.
            ``self.parameters`` is a *view* of ``PartcilePDF.particles``.

        cons (:obj:`tuple` of :obj:`float`): Stores the ``constants``
            argument tuple.

        default_noise_std (:obj:`float`): A rough-estimate of measurement
            noise as a standard-deviation. The default return value of
            ``cost()``.

        measurement_results (:obj:`list`): A list containing records of
            accumulated measurement results

        last_setting_index (:obj:`int`): The most recent settings
            recommendation as an index into ``self.allsettings``.

        N_DRAWS (int): The number of parameter draws to use in the utility
            calculation to estimate the variance of model outputs due to
            parameter distribution.  Default: 30
