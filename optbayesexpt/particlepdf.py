    """A probability distribution function.

    A probability distribution :math:`P(\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\ldots,
    \\theta_{n\_dims})` over parameter variables :math:`\\theta_i` is
    represented by a large-ish number of samples from the distribution,
    each with a weight value.  The distribution can be visualized as a cloud
    of particles in parameter space, with each particle corresponding to a
    weighted random draw from the distribution.  The methods implemented
    here largely follow the algorithms published in Christopher E Granade et
    al. 2012 *New J. Phys.* **14** 103013.

    Warnings:

        The number of samples (i.e. particles) required for good performance
        will depend on the application.  Too many samples will slow down the
        calculations, but too few samples can produce incorrect results.
        With too few samples, the probability distribution can become overly
        narrow, and it may not include the "true" parameter values. See the
        ``resample()`` method documentation for details.

    Args:
        prior (:obj:`2D array-like`): The Bayesian *prior*, which initializes the
            :obj:`ParticlePDF` distribution. Each of ``n_dims`` sub-arrays
            contains ``n_particles`` values of a single parameter, so that
            the *j*\ _th elements of the sub-arrays determine the coordinates
            of a point in parameter space. Users are encouraged to experiment
            with different ``n_particles`` sizes to assure consistent results.

    Keyword Args:
        a_param: (float) In resampling, determines the scale of random
            diffusion relative to the distribution covariance.  After
            weighted sampling, some parameter values may have been
            chosen multiple times. To make the new distribution smoother,
            the parameters are given small 'nudges', random displacements
            much smaller than the overall parameter distribution, but with
            the same shape as the overall distribution.  More precisely,
            the covariance of the nudge distribution is :code:`(1 -
            a_param ** 2)` times the covariance of the parameter distribution.
            Default ``0.98``.

        scale (:obj:`bool`): determines whether resampling includes a
            contraction of the parameter distribution toward the
            distribution mean.  The idea of this contraction is to
            compensate for the overall expansion of the distribution
            that is a by-product of random displacements.  If true,
            parameter samples (particles) move a fraction ``a_param`` of
            the distance to the distribution mean.  Default is ``True``,
            but ``False`` is recommended.

        resample_threshold (:obj:`float`): Sets a threshold for automatic
            resampling. Resampling is triggered when the effective fraction of
            particles, :math:`1 / (N\\sum_i^N w_i^2)`, is smaller than
            ``resample_threshold``.  Default ``0.5``.

        auto_resample (:obj:`bool`): Determines whether threshold testing and
            resampling are performed when ``bayesian_update()`` is called.
            Default ``True``.

        use_jit (:obj:`bool`): Allows precompilation of some methods for a
            modest increase in speed.  Only effective on systems where
            ``numba`` is installed.

    Attributes:
        n_dims (int): The number of parameters, i.e. the dimensionality of
            parameter space.  Determined from the leading dimension of
            ``prior``.

        n_particles (int): the number of parameter samples representing the
            probability distribution.  Determined from the trailing dimension
            of ``prior``.

        particles (ndarray): The ``n_particles`` samples from the
            probability distribution. Its initial value is ``prior``.

        particle_weights (ndarray): Array of n_particles probability weights
            corresponding to the particles.

        tuning_parameters (dict): A :obj:`dict` of parameters affecting the
            resampling algorithm

            - ``'a_param'`` (:obj:`float`): Initially, the value of the
              ``a_param`` keyword argument.  Default ``0.98``

            - ``'scale'`` (:obj:`bool`): Initially, the value of the
              ``scale`` keyword argument. Default ``True``

            - ``'resample_threshold'`` (:obj:`float`):  Initially,
              the value of the ``resample_threshold`` keyword argument.
              Default ``0.5``.

            - ``'auto_resample'`` (:obj:`bool`): Initially, the value of the
              ``auto_resample`` keyword argument. Default ```True``.

        just_resampled (:obj:`bool`): A flag set by the
            ``resample_test()`` function.  ``True`` if the last call
            to ``resample_test()`` resulted in resampling, else ``False``.
